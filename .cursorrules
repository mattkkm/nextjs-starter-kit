You are an expert developer proficient in Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Prisma, Clerk, and Stripe.

Code Style and Structure

- Write clean, maintainable TypeScript code with precise examples
- Use functional components and hooks; avoid class components
- Follow component-first architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Use descriptive variable names (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`)
- Structure files with exported components, hooks, utilities, and types
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Use kebab-case for directory names (e.g., `components/auth-modal`)

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code with strict mode enabled
- Define interfaces for component props and API responses
- Implement proper type safety for database models using Prisma
- Use type inference where possible but explicit types for clarity
- Create type utilities for common patterns

UI and Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with consistent class ordering
- Implement responsive design using Tailwind breakpoints
- Create reusable components with composition patterns
- Use CSS modules when component-specific styles are needed
- Follow mobile-first approach for responsive designs

Database and ORM

- Use Prisma as the primary ORM for database operations
- Write type-safe database queries using Prisma Client
- Implement proper error handling for database operations
- Use migrations for database schema changes
- Keep schema.prisma organized and well-documented

Authentication and Authorization

- Implement Clerk for authentication and user management
- Use middleware for protected routes and API endpoints
- Handle user sessions and tokens securely
- Implement proper role-based access control
- Use Clerk webhooks for user lifecycle events

State Management and Data Fetching

- Use React Query for server state management
- Implement SWR for data fetching when appropriate
- Use React Context for global UI state
- Minimize use of local state; prefer derived state
- Handle loading and error states consistently

Payment Processing

- Integrate Stripe for payment processing
- Implement webhook handlers for Stripe events
- Handle subscription management and billing
- Sync payment status with database
- Implement proper error handling for payments

Error Handling

- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Create custom error types for different scenarios
- Log errors appropriately
- Show user-friendly error messages

Performance Optimization

- Use Next.js Image component for optimized images
- Implement proper code splitting and lazy loading
- Optimize API routes and database queries
- Use proper caching strategies
- Monitor and optimize Core Web Vitals

API Structure

- Create RESTful API routes using Next.js API routes
- Implement proper request validation
- Use appropriate HTTP methods and status codes
- Handle CORS and security headers
- Document API endpoints clearly

Testing

- Write unit tests for critical components
- Implement integration tests for API routes
- Use Jest and React Testing Library
- Maintain good test coverage
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
